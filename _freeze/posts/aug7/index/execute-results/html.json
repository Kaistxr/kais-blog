However, the accompanying statement and minutes were decidedly dovish, sending a clear signal that the Bank's focus is shifting from fighting inflation to supporting a fragile economy.\nGovernor Andrew Bailey cited the \"deteriorating global growth outlook,\" a clear nod to last week's shocking US jobs report and the ongoing trade uncertainty. While UK inflation remains above the 2% target, the MPC's language suggests they believe these external headwinds will do much of their work for them by cooling demand and importing disinflation. The UK 10-year Gilt yield fell on the news, as the market priced in a lower probability of future rate hikes.\n\n::: {#ee67b676 .cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nHTTP Error 404: \n$^FTG10: possibly delisted; no price data found  (period=3mo) (Yahoo error = \"No data found, symbol may be delisted\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<p style='color: red;'>No data returned for Gilt ticker (^FTG10).</p>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### MY TAKE: A Dovish Pause\nThis was a classic \"dovish hold.\" The BoE did what was expected by keeping rates unchanged, but used its statement to signal that the next move is more likely to be a cut than a hike. The vote split is also telling; if a couple of members voted for a cut, it shows the committee is becoming increasingly concerned about a UK recession.\nThe key takeaway is that the BoE has been given an \"out\" by the weak US data. They can now justify pausing their hiking cycle without looking soft on domestic inflation. This is a clear negative for the Pound (GBP), as UK interest rate expectations are being repriced lower, reducing the currency's appeal to international investors.\n\n",
