    "text": "US Bank Earnings Kick Off with a Bang\nIt’s a huge week for market-moving data, and Wall Street has followed on from London bank’s strong Q2 earnings reports. Major US banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, reported Q2 earnings that comfortably beat analyst expectations. The key driver, similar to last week’s theme, was their trading divisions. Volatility in rates and commodities has created a fertile environment for client activity, boosting trading revenues and offsetting continued weakness in M&A and advisory fees. This strong start to earnings season has provided an early boost to market sentiment.\n\n\nIs the Bank of Japan About to Pivot?\nFor decades, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has been the anchor of global low interest rates, pursuing a very loose monetary policy defined by negative rates and Yield Curve Control (YCC). This has made the Japanese Yen the world’s primary funding currency for the “carry trade”; borrowing cheaply in Yen to invest in higher-yielding assets abroad. Now, for the first time in a generation, there are credible signs that this era may be ending.\n\nWhat is Yield Curve Control?\n\nYield curve control (YCC) is a monetary policy tool where a central bank purchases government bonds to target and maintain a specific yield, or interest rate, on those bonds, typically at longer maturities. This strategy aims to influence broader financial conditions and stimulate the economy by keeping long-term interest rates low.\n\n\n\n\n\nYields last seen in 2008.\n\n\n\nWith Japanese inflation finally showing signs of being sustainable and major corporations agreeing to significant wage hikes, the pressure on the BoJ to normalize its policy is immense. The market is now actively pricing in a potential end to YCC and a move away from negative interest rates. The chart below, showing the steady depreciation of the Yen against the US Dollar, is a clear visualization of this long-standing policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD/JPY Exchange Rate - Last 20 Years\n\n\n\n\nA direct consequence of this policy has been the steady depreciation of the Yen against the US Dollar, which is a clear visualization of the carry trade in action.\n\nMY TAKE: THE END OF THE CARRY TRADE\nThe potential unwinding of the Japanese carry trade is one of the biggest stories in macro right now. For years, hedge funds and institutional investors have borrowed trillions of Yen for next to nothing to fund investments in everything from US Treasuries to high-yielding emerging market debt.\nIf the BoJ pivots on IRs, and Japanese yields start to rise, this entire trade goes into reverse. Investors would be forced to sell their foreign assets and buy back Yen to repay their loans. This would trigger a massive repatriation of capital back to Japan, leading to a surge in the Yen’s value and significant selling pressure on global assets, particularly those that are popular carry trade destinations.\nThe potential trade is to go long the Yen (vs. USD or EUR) in anticipation of this shift. It’s a crowded trade, but the asymmetry is compelling. The downside is limited by the BoJ’s current policy, while the upside from a full policy normalization is enormous. Although a potential concern could be straining relations and limited resolutions regarding trade deals. With Japan and the U.S. in their 7th round of negotiations!\n\n\n\nNvidia continues to carry U.S. Equity Markets.\nEquity market gains were once again driven by the tech sector, with Nvidia at the forefront. The AI chip giant announced plans to resume sales of its H20 chips to China after the Trump administration lifted certain export restrictions. However, much of the morning’s optimism faded by the close, with tech ending as the only sector in the green."

    "text": "Theme of the Week: Trading Outshines Banking\nA clear theme is emerging as banks begin to report their Q2 earnings: traders continue to ride the volatility ‘wave’. Across Wall Street, firms are seeing their Sales & Trading divisions post bumper profits, driven by client activity around whipsawing commodity prices and interest rate uncertainty. This stands in stark contrast to the more subdued performance from traditional Investment Banking (M&A, IPOs), where deal flow remains sluggish. This divergence highlights a key market dynamic: while uncertainty can stall corporate activity, it provides fertile ground for trading desks.\n\n\n\n\n\nCBOE Volatility Index (VIX) - Last 6 Months\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopper Arbitrage: The Tariff Windfall\nFollowing up on last week’s analysis of the US copper tariff, the real winners are becoming clear: the major commodity trading houses. Firms like Glencore and Trafigura are reportedly set for a $300 million windfall by exploiting the price arbitrage between the LME and COMEX markets. By purchasing copper on the cheaper international market and shipping it to the US to sell at the inflated, tariff-protected price, they are capitalizing on the exact market dislocation we discussed.\n\nMY TAKE\nThis is a classic example of how physical logistics and market access create immense value in commodities trading. While the trade itself is simple in theory, only a handful of players have the global infrastructure to execute it at scale. It underscores that in commodities, it’s not just about predicting price direction but also about controlling the flow of the underlying asset.\n\n\n\nBarclays Q2 Earnings: A Tale of Two Divisions\nThis morning, Barclays reported its second-quarter earnings, perfectly illustrating the week’s theme. The bank significantly beat expectations, driven almost entirely by its FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) trading division, which saw revenues jump 25% year-over-year. In contrast, its advisory and capital markets unit was largely flat.\nMY TAKE & A Personal Note Barclays’ results confirm that market-facing divisions are the engine of growth in this environment. The news reminded me to check up on the plant seeds I received from Barclays at a careers fair earlier this year. Just as the trading floor thrives on the right conditions, this plant has been a small project in nurturing growth; benefitting from a combination of great sunlight levels and watering. I’ll keep readers updated with the plant’s progress as we approach application season.\n\n\n\n\nMay: Just starting out\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly: Showing strong growth\n\n\n\nSeeing this physical growth is a great metaphor for my own progress. Just as the plant needs the right inputs to flourish, my goal over these months is to cultivate my skills and market knowledge to be ready for the fast-paced environment of a trading floor."

Yesterday, the chipmaker became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization. This valuation places it ahead of tech giants like Microsoft and Apple, cementing its position as the undisputed leader in the AI hardware space.\nFor traders, NVIDIA’s ascent is more than just a remarkable growth story; it’s a barometer for the entire tech sector and a significant driver of major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The key takeaways are:\n\nMarket Concentration: NVIDIA now represents over 7% of the S&P 500. Its performance has an outsized impact on the broader market, creating both opportunities and concentration risks.\nInvestor Sentiment: The demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs remains incredibly strong, reflecting a widespread belief that the AI boom is still in its early to middle innings.\nFuture Challenges: While the outlook is strong, potential headwinds exist. The most notable are the ongoing US restrictions on advanced chip exports to China.\n\n\nMY TAKE ON THE STORY\nThe primary question isn’t whether NVIDIA is a great company, but whether its valuation is sustainable. The smarter play isn’t to bet against NVIDIA, but to look for second-order beneficiaries that aren’t as crowded. The AI boom requires a massive build-out of infrastructure, meaning power grid operators and utility companies. These are the less glamorous “shovels” of the AI gold rush.\nA company on my radar in this space includes:\nNational Grid (NG.L): As a major utility, it stands to benefit from the massive increase in electricity demand from new data centers.\n\n\n\nThe Copper Shock: Unpacking Trump’s 50% Tariff\nIn a move that sent shockwaves through the commodities markets, President Trump has confirmed a 50% tariff on all copper imports, expected to take effect by early August. This has immediate and significant implications, from price dislocation between COMEX and LME benchmarks to broad inflationary pressure. For the trading desk, this creates volatility and opportunity.\n\nMY TAKE ON THE COPPER TARIFF\nThis is a purely political move with messy, real-world economic consequences. The clear inflationary impact puts the Federal Reserve in a bind. If input costs are rising due to tariffs, the Fed may be forced to keep interest rates higher for longer.\nPotential trade ideas stemming from this:\n\nLong US Copper Producers: They will see their margins expand significantly.\nShort EV/Green Energy Companies: This tariff acts as a direct tax on these copper-intensive sectors.\nConsider Volatility: This kind of unpredictable event increases overall market uncertainty. A long position on a volatility index like the VIX could be a sensible hedge.\n\n\n\n$7 Coffees the New Norm?\nIn other commodities news, coffee futures rose sharply after President Trump announced potential 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil, a global leader in coffee production. This is another example of trade policy directly impacting consumer prices and creating new inflationary pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworking & Jobs Update (July 11)\n\n\n\nEvent Series Highlight: Meet UBS Roadshow\nApplications for the UBS’s European recruitment events have just opened. With 2 UK cities receiving a visit: Birmingham & Bath.\nLink: Meet UBS\nInternship Deadlines Fast Approaching! But don’t stress!\nMany banks will open their Summer 2026 internship applications in late August/early September. Now is the time to be finalising your CV, upskilling, and networking.\nStart reaching out to alumni from your university on LinkedIn who are in roles you’re interested in. A short, polite message asking for a 15-minute chat can go a long way. And hey, you may even realise you’d hate to do what they’re doing!"
