Yesterday, the chipmaker became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization. This valuation places it ahead of tech giants like Microsoft and Apple, cementing its position as the undisputed leader in the AI hardware space.\nFor traders, NVIDIA’s ascent is more than just a remarkable growth story; it’s a barometer for the entire tech sector and a significant driver of major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The key takeaways are:\n\nMarket Concentration: NVIDIA now represents over 7% of the S&P 500. Its performance has an outsized impact on the broader market, creating both opportunities and concentration risks.\nInvestor Sentiment: The demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs remains incredibly strong, reflecting a widespread belief that the AI boom is still in its early to middle innings.\nFuture Challenges: While the outlook is strong, potential headwinds exist. The most notable are the ongoing US restrictions on advanced chip exports to China.\n\n\nMY TAKE ON THE STORY\nThe primary question isn’t whether NVIDIA is a great company, but whether its valuation is sustainable. The smarter play isn’t to bet against NVIDIA, but to look for second-order beneficiaries that aren’t as crowded. The AI boom requires a massive build-out of infrastructure, meaning power grid operators and utility companies. These are the less glamorous “shovels” of the AI gold rush.\nA company on my radar in this space includes:\nNational Grid (NG.L): As a major utility, it stands to benefit from the massive increase in electricity demand from new data centers.\n\n\n\nThe Copper Shock: Unpacking Trump’s 50% Tariff\nIn a move that sent shockwaves through the commodities markets, President Trump has confirmed a 50% tariff on all copper imports, expected to take effect by early August. This has immediate and significant implications, from price dislocation between COMEX and LME benchmarks to broad inflationary pressure. For the trading desk, this creates volatility and opportunity.\n\nMY TAKE ON THE COPPER TARIFF\nThis is a purely political move with messy, real-world economic consequences. The clear inflationary impact puts the Federal Reserve in a bind. If input costs are rising due to tariffs, the Fed may be forced to keep interest rates higher for longer.\nPotential trade ideas stemming from this:\n\nLong US Copper Producers: They will see their margins expand significantly.\nShort EV/Green Energy Companies: This tariff acts as a direct tax on these copper-intensive sectors.\nConsider Volatility: This kind of unpredictable event increases overall market uncertainty. A long position on a volatility index like the VIX could be a sensible hedge.\n\n\n\n$7 Coffees the New Norm?\nIn other commodities news, coffee futures rose sharply after President Trump announced potential 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil, a global leader in coffee production. This is another example of trade policy directly impacting consumer prices and creating new inflationary pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworking & Jobs Update (July 11)\n\n\n\nEvent Series Highlight: Meet UBS Roadshow\nApplications for the UBS’s European recruitment events have just opened. With 2 UK cities receiving a visit: Birmingham & Bath.\nLink: Meet UBS\nInternship Deadlines Fast Approaching! But don’t stress!\nMany banks will open their Summer 2026 internship applications in late August/early September. Now is the time to be finalising your CV, upskilling, and networking.\nStart reaching out to alumni from your university on LinkedIn who are in roles you’re interested in. A short, polite message asking for a 15-minute chat can go a long way. And hey, you may even realise you’d hate to do what they’re doing!"
